The Luggage Makefile for producing a package to enable the guest account, currently only on 10.7 and higher machines.

Because I haven't been able to figure out how to do the keychains correctly, I have the following lines as part of a launchagent running on all of our lab machines.

if [[ ${USER} == 'Guest' ]]; then
	# Until I can figure out how to get this created properly, we need to
	# create the keychain, and then assign it as the login keychain to the
	# guest user
	keychain='/Users/Guest/Library/Keychains/login.keychain'
	security create-keychain -p '' $keychain
	security login-keychain -s $keychain
fi
